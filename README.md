## Maya 2014
You can find the scripts used for building Qt, PyQt, [here](https://github.com/cyrillef/Maya-PyQt-Scripts/releases/tag/v2014.0).

Maya 2014 is shipping with PySide, therefore there is no more need to build PySide.

libxml, openSSL, OpenAL, python2.7, qt-4.8.2-64, and tbb are also coming by default in the Maya include and lib folder, so unless you have a very 
specific need, you would not need to rebuild any of those libraries like before.
